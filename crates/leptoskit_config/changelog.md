## [0.3.1](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/releases/tag/v0.3.1) (2026-11-13)

### Features

- **Multiple frontend applications in one workspace.** `leptoskit new --frontends landing,app,admin` scaffolds a `leptoskit.workspace.toml` with separate apps under `apps/` (landing and admin web-only; `app` keeps native hosts). Workspace applications may declare an optional `kind` (`landing`, `product`, `admin`, `server`) for tooling. Docs cover the multi-frontend layout; shared auth across frontends remains out of scope. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #701](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/701)

#### Versioned native capability contracts

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #630](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/630)

Native builds now resolve a typed host capability descriptor from the destination flavour, the plugin registrations they actually generated, and the non-secret plugin options. `native bundle` writes `capabilities.json` beside the bundle with a stable SHA-256 digest, and the mobile host embeds the same descriptor in `codepush.json`.

`[native]` gains `required-plugins`, `optional-plugins`, `required-capabilities`, and `optional-capabilities`. A required plugin or capability the selected host cannot run fails the build before packaging, regardless of `missing-plugins`; an optional omission warns with the platform and reason. Existing `plugins` and `missing-plugins` keep their behavior when no requirement lists are set, and a capability declaration never grants access.

Signed releases carry versioned required/optional requirements in `runtime.json`. The installed host checks them against its own descriptor before staging or activating an update; unsupported, unknown, or experimental-without-opt-in requirements are refused. Releases built before this format still pass the legacy ABI, shell, and plugin checks and are reported as legacy, never as verified-compatible. Unknown contract versions and conflicting or duplicate entries are rejected.

Guest requirements bind the bridge protocol as well as the rendering ABI. Explicitly optional plugins no longer enter the legacy required-plugin list. Watch preparation checks requirements before writing its stubs and emits a descriptor; standalone bundles place host evidence beside the output directory.

Updates whose older-style plugin grants have no available implementation report `incomplete` while preserving the existing missing-plugin fallback. Explicit required entries still reject unavailable plugins; explicit optional entries may be omitted. A versioned host descriptor must agree with its own grant list before it can check a release.

Generated iOS and Android update controls show whether host requirements were checked, plugin availability remains incomplete, or only legacy checks ran. A missing report from an older runtime is shown as unreported. None of these states claims that the updated app passed device tests.

The descriptor also names `host.timer` where the generated host enables the reserved `leptoskit.timer` plugin, so `required-capabilities = ["host.timer"]` fails before packaging on hosts that run no guest and is checked by code push on older store builds.

#### Describe independently configured applications

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #629](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/629)

Add a separate `leptoskit.workspace.toml` manifest and `lk workspace explain` / `check`. Each application references its own configuration. Startup dependencies are validated independently of call bindings, so bidirectional calls do not become readiness cycles. Unknown references, escaping paths, repeated configurations, conflicting managed identities, and duplicate binding variables fail before a build starts.

The versioned report exposes only selected configuration and environment variable names. It explicitly marks artifacts, API compatibility, database ownership, service identity, and deployment as not checked. Workspace inspection runs no plugin programs or build tools. Image creation, binding injection, change impact, and release orchestration remain future consumers of this graph.

#### Augmented and virtual reality, and Meta Quest apps

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #659](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/659)

The new `leptoskit_xr` crate and its `xr` plugin put an app in the real world. Start a session in the best mode the device has — `PhoneAr` through ARKit on iOS and ARCore on Android, `ImmersiveVr` and `ImmersiveAr` on headsets through OpenXR, WebXR in the browser, or `Orientation`, which turns the view with the phone on any device — and read a stream of frames: where the viewer is, each view's projection, the floors, tables, and walls found so far, pinned anchors, the room's light, and controllers and hands. Hit tests find where a tap or a controller's ray meets the real world, against planes and, on phones that measure it, the depth of the room. The camera and depth pictures stay in the native app for the renderer, and the frames your code receives are capped at `[native.plugin-options.xr] max-frame-rate`, always the newest. A recording replays a session exactly, for tests and simulators, with `replay = "…"`.

`leptoskit build --platform quest` builds the Android project as a Meta Quest app, with the manifest Horizon OS expects: OpenXR, head tracking, optional hand tracking and passthrough, the supported headsets, and a full-screen immersive launcher. `[native.quest]` configures it, and `leptoskit dev --platform quest` installs onto a connected headset.

With the `3d` feature, `host::scene3d::draw` draws a `leptoskit_3d` scene into a session: the camera picture behind it, real-world depth hiding what is behind real things, and one view per eye on a headset.

The backends build for their platforms but have not yet run on a device, so treat them as experimental.

### Fixes

- **More ergonomic multi-frontend scaffold.** `--frontends` alone scaffolds landing, app, and admin. Ports are stable per kind. The product app under `apps/app` uses the workspace name as its Cargo package. Frontend names trim whitespace and accept ASCII case; `ApplicationKind` gains `FromStr`, `Display`, and helpers used by the scaffold. Each frontend app uses the same file-router defaults as a normal `leptoskit new`. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #703](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/703)

#### Accept managed registries with explicit ports

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #629](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/629)

Managed image configuration accepts a registry hostname with a numeric port and an image repository under that registry. Invalid ports, embedded credentials, paths in registry authorities, and tagged image repositories remain rejected.

Verified image packaging accepts `--service <infra.name>` to include Kamal’s required service label in the independently pinned image configuration. Reusing an image checks the label along with the rest of that configuration.

Deployment accepts Docker’s null defaults for absent Podman `Cmd`, `OnBuild`, and `Volumes` inspection fields while still requiring the exact content-addressed image ID. Non-null changes remain rejected.

#### Immersive sessions from Meta Quest panel apps

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #691](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/691)

A Quest app now draws its 3D scene into the headset. Start an `ImmersiveVr` or `ImmersiveAr` session and choose the scene with the new `Session::present(Some(scene_id))`: each eye sees the scene from the player's eye, over passthrough in `ImmersiveAr`. An app built with `[native.quest] immersive = false`, a 2D panel, opens an immersive activity over the panel for the session and comes back to the panel in Horizon Home when the session ends, while its code keeps running and receiving frames.

`leptoskit build --platform quest` declares that activity in every Quest app, marks a panel app's launcher with Horizon OS's 2D category and targets Horizon OS v69, and turns on `leptoskit_xr`'s new `quest` feature (or any async plugin's `quest` feature). For hosts that draw scenes themselves, `leptoskit_3d::host::Hub::draw_scene` draws a scene on another device, such as a headset's, and `Hub::forget_device` moves scenes off it again.

None of this has run on a headset yet.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/releases/tag/v0.3.0) (2026-11-06)

### Breaking changes

#### leptoskit_config: project configuration

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #429](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/429)

`leptoskit_config` loads and validates `leptoskit.toml`: app identity and platforms, server and build settings, native targets and plugin grants, code push channels, routes, translations, the database, sign-in, infrastructure, browser extensions, store publishing, plugins, formatting, and lint settings.

The CLI, build pipeline, dev server, and native hosts all read the same typed configuration, so they agree on what the app is. Unknown keys fail at load time instead of being ignored. The schema is versioned (version 0, unstable until version 1); `leptoskit migrate` upgrades an older file, and the `schema` feature generates its JSON Schema.

### Features

#### Try native plugins written only in Rust

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #506](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/506)

Set `native.experimental-rust-plugins = true` in `leptoskit.toml` to use the experimental pure-Rust `clipboard` and `haptics` plugins on iOS, macOS, and Android in place of their Swift and Kotlin versions. Without the setting, builds keep the Swift and Kotlin versions.

A plugin of your own can do the same in its `[package.metadata.leptoskit.runtime]` tables. With `rust-context = true`, its factory receives a `leptoskit_bridge::AppContext`, whose `platform()` lends the host's native handles: the `JavaVM` and app `Context` on Android, and the on-screen view controller on iOS and macOS. With `rust-main-thread = true`, its calls run on the platform's UI thread, which UIKit, AppKit, and most Android UI APIs require (`App::install_main` installs such a plugin by hand). Mark a platform's registration `experimental = true` to use it only when the setting is on.

- **Theme tokens in leptoskit.toml and deeper CSS var().** `[theme.colors]` and `[theme.lengths]` in `leptoskit.toml` name design tokens that `Theme::install_maps` loads into the process-wide Theme map. Arbitrary color and length utilities accept `var(--name)`, one nested `var()` fallback, and `/opacity` on color vars. The web adapter prepends `Theme::css()` so the browser sees the same `:root` custom properties native resolves through Theme. Tailwind `@theme` / `tailwind.config` files remain unsupported. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #538](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/538)

### Fixes

- **Correct README claims about generated renderers, accessibility, runtime plugin registration, password screens, RPC macros, and interpreter updates.** Share crate summaries with Rust documentation and derive MSRV badges from Cargo through MDT templates, with a documentation drift check. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #515](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/515)

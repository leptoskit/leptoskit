## [0.3.1](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/releases/tag/v0.3.1) (2026-11-13)

### Fixes

- **Harden native-wave plugin correctness.** Live Activities on iOS cancel push-token waits without freezing the per-id busy lock, replace duplicate ActivityKit ids on start, and reject duplicate content keys. Picture-in-picture leases best-effort exit system PiP and observe user exit; `request_overlay` docs match launch-time status. Home widgets stop reporting unrelated pins for unknown kinds, commit preferences before success, and reject dangerous URL schemes. Device-policy and Live Activities stubs validate payloads before Unavailable. Wear/watchOS hosts return errors instead of panicking on viewport kind mismatch. New Android hosts declare `supportsPictureInPicture` on MainActivity. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #618](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/618)

### Added

#### Experimental watchOS host stubs

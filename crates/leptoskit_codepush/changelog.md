### Features

#### Versioned native capability contracts

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #630](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/630)

Native builds now resolve a typed host capability descriptor from the destination flavour, the plugin registrations they actually generated, and the non-secret plugin options. `native bundle` writes `capabilities.json` beside the bundle with a stable SHA-256 digest, and the mobile host embeds the same descriptor in `codepush.json`.

`[native]` gains `required-plugins`, `optional-plugins`, `required-capabilities`, and `optional-capabilities`. A required plugin or capability the selected host cannot run fails the build before packaging, regardless of `missing-plugins`; an optional omission warns with the platform and reason. Existing `plugins` and `missing-plugins` keep their behavior when no requirement lists are set, and a capability declaration never grants access.

Signed releases carry versioned required/optional requirements in `runtime.json`. The installed host checks them against its own descriptor before staging or activating an update; unsupported, unknown, or experimental-without-opt-in requirements are refused. Releases built before this format still pass the legacy ABI, shell, and plugin checks and are reported as legacy, never as verified-compatible. Unknown contract versions and conflicting or duplicate entries are rejected.

Guest requirements bind the bridge protocol as well as the rendering ABI. Explicitly optional plugins no longer enter the legacy required-plugin list. Watch preparation checks requirements before writing its stubs and emits a descriptor; standalone bundles place host evidence beside the output directory.

Updates whose older-style plugin grants have no available implementation report `incomplete` while preserving the existing missing-plugin fallback. Explicit required entries still reject unavailable plugins; explicit optional entries may be omitted. A versioned host descriptor must agree with its own grant list before it can check a release.

Generated iOS and Android update controls show whether host requirements were checked, plugin availability remains incomplete, or only legacy checks ran. A missing report from an older runtime is shown as unreported. None of these states claims that the updated app passed device tests.

The descriptor also names `host.timer` where the generated host enables the reserved `leptoskit.timer` plugin, so `required-capabilities = ["host.timer"]` fails before packaging on hosts that run no guest and is checked by code push on older store builds.

### Breaking changes

#### leptoskit_codepush: over-the-air updates

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #429](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/429)

`leptoskit_codepush` ships interface changes to native apps without a store review: signed, content-hashed releases of the Wasm bundle, packed into one file, with binary deltas so a device downloads only the chunks that changed.

`leptoskit codepush` packs, signs, and publishes releases to a static channel layout that any file server, object store, or CDN can host, and `leptoskit_wasm` stages them on the device. A client accepts only releases signed by a trusted key and newer than what it runs, so a compromised registry can neither ship its own code nor roll a device back. A host can also require independent source approvals: rebuilders who built the same files from a public commit and signed to say so.

### Fixes

- **Correct README claims about generated renderers, accessibility, runtime plugin registration, password screens, RPC macros, and interpreter updates.** Share crate summaries with Rust documentation and derive MSRV badges from Cargo through MDT templates, with a documentation drift check. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #515](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/515)

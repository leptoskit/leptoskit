### Fixes

#### Smaller server-rendered pages

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #741](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/741)

Server-rendered and static pages no longer repeat leptoskit's style reset for every differently styled element. Each element's typed styles start from about sixty declarations, such as `display:flex`, `flex-shrink:0`, and zeroed margins and padding, and every distinct look carried its own copy of all of them, about a kilobyte each. `leptoskit::web::render` now writes those defaults once per stylesheet, and each style scope's sheet holds only what differs from them, often a single declaration. Elements look the same: the defaults keep the specificity and order they had, below utility classes. A list of two dozen rows that differ only in width used to carry 27 copies of the reset and now carries one, and its markup is under 9 KB. Style scopes are also 16 hex digits instead of 64, since every element carries its scope.

The root element of each render now carries `data-lk-root`, which keeps one render's defaults from resetting the elements of a render earlier in the page. `leptoskit_testing_library` leaves it out of the markup it prints, as it does `data-lk-style`.

### Breaking changes

#### leptoskit_testing_library: browser component tests

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #429](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/429)

`leptoskit_testing_library` provides Testing Library queries and widget-test actions for leptoskit components mounted in a real browser.

It mounts through the web renderer and shares finders with `leptoskit_testing`, so a team can test the browser build with the same vocabulary it uses for native widget tests.

### Fixes

- **Correct README claims about generated renderers, accessibility, runtime plugin registration, password screens, RPC macros, and interpreter updates.** Share crate summaries with Rust documentation and derive MSRV badges from Cargo through MDT templates, with a documentation drift check. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #515](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/515)

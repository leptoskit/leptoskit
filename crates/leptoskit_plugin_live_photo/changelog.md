## [0.3.1](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/releases/tag/v0.3.1) (2026-11-13)

### Features

- **Add `leptoskit_plugin_live_photo` with create/start/stop/status/release and a `LivePhoto` surface bound by session id (`PHLivePhotoView`).** Android and browser remain Unavailable; editing remains later scope. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #692](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/692)

### Fixes

#### Apple plugin and JNI builds on current toolchains

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #718](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/718)

The Apple plugin packages now build and test against the current Xcode SDK. Wire readers no longer declare a `bytes` method that shadows their storage, wire-case helpers have distinct names, calendar validation is shared, EventKit events with no identifier fail honestly, camera photo delegates are retained behind a lock, Security keys use the CF bridge, print uses the current AppKit HTML and PDF APIs, and ActivityKit code is iOS-only. Delegate conformances are main-actor isolated, and the tests import internal wire types with `@testable` and supply a real presentation owner.

The JNI smoke test now finds the JDK through `JAVA_HOME`, invokes the macOS SDK compiler through `xcrun`, and stubs the 3D, timer, and DevTools entry points that the application bridge links.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

### Features

#### leptoskit_plugin_live_photo: Live Photo sessions and surface

`leptoskit_plugin_live_photo` creates host-owned Live Photo sessions from `ph://` asset ids, starts hint or full playback, and binds them to the `LivePhoto` element. Android and browser hosts return Unavailable. Editing remains later scope. Guests enable `guest` and reuse `guest::LivePhoto`.

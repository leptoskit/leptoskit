## [0.3.1](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/releases/tag/v0.3.1) (2026-11-13)

### Features

#### App shortcuts, icon badges, and NFC reads

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #581](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/581)

Three new runtime plugins cover high-value native capabilities that were still missing:

- **`app-shortcuts`** publishes up to eight static launcher shortcuts (iOS quick actions, Android `ShortcutManager`, macOS dock-menu store) and returns the id that launched the app.
- **`badge`** sets, reads, and clears the app icon badge count on Apple and Android, with a Linux Unity/KDE D-Bus client for custom hosts.
- **`nfc`** queries hardware readiness and reads one bounded NDEF text or URI record on iOS and Android.

Each plugin ships guest clients, wire codecs, Apple/Android backends (with stubs where a platform has no hardware), docs, and tests. Windows jump-list publishing, full Siri App Intents, background NFC, and badge Badging API support remain follow-ups.

### Fixes

#### Apple plugin and JNI builds on current toolchains

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #718](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/pull/718)

The Apple plugin packages now build and test against the current Xcode SDK. Wire readers no longer declare a `bytes` method that shadows their storage, wire-case helpers have distinct names, calendar validation is shared, EventKit events with no identifier fail honestly, camera photo delegates are retained behind a lock, Security keys use the CF bridge, print uses the current AppKit HTML and PDF APIs, and ActivityKit code is iOS-only. Delegate conformances are main-actor isolated, and the tests import internal wire types with `@testable` and supply a real presentation owner.

The JNI smoke test now finds the JDK through `JAVA_HOME`, invokes the macOS SDK compiler through `xcrun`, and stubs the 3D, timer, and DevTools entry points that the application bridge links.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

### Features

#### leptoskit_plugin_nfc: one-shot NDEF reads

`leptoskit_plugin_nfc` queries NFC readiness and reads one bounded NDEF text or URI record on iOS and Android. Guests enable the `guest` feature and reuse `guest::Nfc`.

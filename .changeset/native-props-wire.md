# Native props read the same whatever serde_json's features

An Android app that also used Solana's clients drew nothing: its first vector failed in the Wasm host with `invalid type: map, expected f32`. Those clients turn on serde_json's `arbitrary_precision` for the whole build, and under it a buffered number with a fraction is a map. The host read a node's props through `#[serde(flatten)]`, which buffers every value, and so did each animation `Keyframe`.

The host now reads a node with `WireNode::from_json`: the props and the keys beside them in two passes, with nothing buffered, and `Keyframe` lists its look's `opacity` and `transform` itself. Its JSON is unchanged.

The guest and the host now share `leptoskit_native::wire`: one table of kind codes and one `WireNode`. That fixes two more ways the sides disagreed:

- The host's own kind table stopped at `Camera`, so a `Map` or a `LivePhoto` showed as a plain view.
- An image's `source` was taken by the DevTools location, which used the same key, so native images had no source. A `DevTools` guest now sends its location as `source_location`.

`test:wire` runs the guest-to-host tests under `arbitrary_precision` too.

# Screen state and queries survive a rebuild

leptoskit builds a screen again whenever a signal it read changes. Two things broke under that: a `RwSignal::new(..)` inside a screen ran again with every rebuild, so a chosen filter or a typed field reset as soon as the screen redrew, and a `use_query` in a screen refetched in a loop, because the rebuild its data caused mounted the query again while the data already counted as stale.

- `leptoskit_native`: `remember(|| initial)` returns the same `RwSignal` on every build of the screen, told apart by its place in the source and by order. `remember_keyed(&key, || initial)` names the value by a key instead, for rows that move. A value is released once a whole build no longer reaches it, such as after navigating to another route. `guest::mount` keeps the values for native apps. In the browser, `web::screen(move || ..)` replaces `move || web::render(..)` and does the same. `ScreenState` is the store underneath, for hosts of their own. Both functions are in `leptoskit::prelude`, and the module is `leptoskit::remember`.
- `leptoskit_query`: a query mounted within two seconds of this client's last fetch of it takes that fetch's data or error instead of fetching again, like SWR's deduping interval. The window covers `RefetchOn::Always` and `retry_on_mount`, and not invalidation, `refetch()`, focus, reconnect, or intervals. Data from `set_query_data`, initial data, or hydration doesn't count as a fetch. Set it with `with_mount_dedupe` on `QueryDefaults`, `QueryOptions`, or `QueryObserverOptions`; `Duration::ZERO` gives TanStack's behaviour. `QueryOptions`, `QueryDefaults`, and `ResolvedQueryOptions` gain a `mount_dedupe` field, so code that builds them with struct literals needs it too.

An app with its own keyed store and a long stale time to work around this can switch to `remember` and drop both.

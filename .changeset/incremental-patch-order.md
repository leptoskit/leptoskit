# Regions committed together keep their own widgets

`NativeSurface::try_patch` applies patches in tree order, and it answered in that order too, though its contract (and the wasm host, which pairs each answer with the patch it sent) is the order given. A commit that changed two regions whose wire ids ran against the tree, such as a label above a list that gained a row, paired one region's wire ids with the other's widgets. A debug host stopped with "surface and wire tree diverged"; a release host could send a widget's events to another node. On a Solana Seeker, buying anything in Reapers stopped the app.

`try_patch` now answers in the order given. The wasm host's incremental tests check, after every commit, that each widget pairs with the wire node it was built from.

Preserve null, empty collections and omitted arguments in generated SDK requests.

Query and form encoders now match the server's serde_qs 1.1 protocol: explicit null is a bare key and an empty collection is `key=`. JSON and live encoders keep explicit null, and required nullable arguments in Go and Rust keep their keys. Python optional arguments use the exported `UNSET` for omission and `None` for explicit null. Generated Rust and CLI packages need `serde_qs` 1.1.3; update an existing package's manifest when regenerating its code.

Clients, OpenAPI, AsyncAPI and compatibility checks now follow each argument's `required` flag rather than inferring it from nullability. Specs from `#[api]` functions mark `Option` arguments optional, because the server reads a missing key as `None`. The spec format is now version 4; older specs still load, and their nullable arguments stay optional. A spec written by this version needs an equally new CLI to generate clients.

In regenerated Dart clients, `Option` arguments become optional `Presence<T?>` parameters instead of required `T?` ones. Omit them, or pass `Presence.present(value)`.

Strict diagnostics report a Go or Rust optional nullable argument only when its schema declares a default, and no longer report a Dart query/form limitation that the encoder now handles. Mandatory SDK acceptance decodes generated HTTP requests with the server codec.

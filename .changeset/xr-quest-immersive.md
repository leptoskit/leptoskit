# Immersive sessions from Meta Quest panel apps

A Quest app now draws its 3D scene into the headset. Start an `ImmersiveVr` or `ImmersiveAr` session and choose the scene with the new `Session::present(Some(scene_id))`: each eye sees the scene from the player's eye, over passthrough in `ImmersiveAr`. An app built with `[native.quest] immersive = false`, a 2D panel, opens an immersive activity over the panel for the session and comes back to the panel in Horizon Home when the session ends, while its code keeps running and receiving frames.

`leptoskit build --platform quest` declares that activity in every Quest app, marks a panel app's launcher with Horizon OS's 2D category and targets Horizon OS v69, and turns on `leptoskit_xr`'s new `quest` feature (or any async plugin's `quest` feature). For hosts that draw scenes themselves, `leptoskit_3d::host::Hub::draw_scene` draws a scene on another device, such as a headset's, and `Hub::forget_device` moves scenes off it again.

None of this has run on a headset yet.

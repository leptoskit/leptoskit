# Android Back goes back a route

The Back gesture and Back button in an Android app now go back one route through the file router, and leave the app only from the first route. Before, Back always left the app: Android 16 delivers Back to an app that targets it only through an `OnBackInvokedCallback`, which the generated activity never registered, and on every Android version the host's question to the router went nowhere.

- `leptoskit_wasm`: `WasmHost::system_back` offers Back to the guest's optional `leptoskit_system_back` export, then flushes and commits what changed. A guest without the export answers `EventOutcome::Unhandled`, and the platform leaves.
- `leptoskit_bridge_ffi`: `lk_guest_system_back` offers Back on the guest thread, and `lk_guest_take_system_back` takes the answers in order. `LeptosKitApplicationView.offerSystemBack` now takes a callback, `(Boolean) -> Unit`, that runs on the main thread with `true` when the router went back.
- `leptoskit_cli`: the generated `MainActivity.kt` registers an `OnBackInvokedCallback` on Android 13 and later and keeps `onBackPressed` for earlier versions; the generated manifest sets `android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true"`.

Apps scaffolded before this keep leaving on Back until they copy the new `MainActivity.kt` Back code and the manifest attribute from a new project; [the Android page](https://leptoskit.dev/docs/platforms/android.html#the-back-gesture) lists them.

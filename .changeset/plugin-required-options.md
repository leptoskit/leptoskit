# Plugin options the app would crash on stop the build instead

An Android app whose `leptoskit.toml` had an empty `[native.plugin-options.websocket]` built, installed, and then stopped at launch with `NativeApplicationInitializationFailure: register plugin: InvalidArgument`. The WebSocket plugin can't start without `origins`, the build only checked that the table was there, and the error didn't say which plugin had failed.

`leptoskit build` now stops with the plugin and the option it needs:

```
plugin `websocket` needs `origins` in [native.plugin-options.websocket]: without it, the app stops at launch when the plugin starts
```

An async plugin lists the options its factory can't start without in its runtime metadata, and an empty string, list, or table counts as left out:

```toml
[package.metadata.leptoskit.runtime]
name = "websocket"
rust-factory = "from_config"
rust-async = true
required-options = ["origins"]
```

`http` and `websocket` require `origins`, `shell` requires `commands`, and `xr` requires nothing. Each crate's tests hold its factory to its list.

When a plugin still fails to start, the error names it: ``register plugin `websocket`: InvalidArgument``. Generated registrants install every plugin through the new `App::register`, and a host directory that can't be used is reported as `app context: …` rather than as a plugin's failure.

The `shell` plugin is now left out of iOS, Android, and HarmonyOS builds, where it can't start processes and its factory always failed, which also stopped the app at launch.

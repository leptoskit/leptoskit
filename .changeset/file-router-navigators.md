# File-route navigators, deep links, and system Back

Layouts can export `navigator()` returning a typed `Stack`, `Tabs`, or `Drawer`. Folder groups like `(tabs)/` stay URL-less; the navigator return value chooses the chrome. Tab and drawer roots are `impl Into<Route>`, not string names. Stacks can present matched routes as a sheet or modal above the previous screen, and optionally offer an edge hit target for Back.

`Navigation::open_url` / `open_url_with` turn incoming URLs into typed routes (custom schemes and `http(s)`). `apply_activations` drains a host deep-link queue into the router. `bind_system_back` and `leptoskit_system_back` let Android system Back pop router history when the host offers it. Generated Android activities call into that path before finishing.

[`examples/file_routes`](https://github.com/leptoskit/leptoskit/tree/main/examples/file_routes) shows Stack + Tabs + Drawer, deep links, and Back. True UIKit interactive-pop and AppKit history swipe still need host presentation; the guide names those gaps.
